# AlkerniaLegends

This is a 2D platformer game project I worked back in 2018-19, tried to encorporate 'Game feel & juice' (concept from GameDevsToolkit yt channel).. Made it for fun, was inspired by Super mario, as it was one of the first games i really liked as a child..



Scripting was done in Construct 2 using Javascript & the visual scripting system

Made the assets in Aseprite & used some open source assets as well
